# Mobile-Price-Prediction-using-ML-Algorithm
I have implemented a Mobile price prediction using different Machine Learning Algorithms. This project will classify the price range of the mobile price. The prices range from 0-3. We'll discuss the price range in the dataset. Now I have trained a mobile price classification using 3 ML algorithms. This model classifies the range of the mobile based on the different parameters like from camera,touch screen, cores,battery,capacity,etc.After training the model using 3 algorithms,I compared all the models using the graph.
